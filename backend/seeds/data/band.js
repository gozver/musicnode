const aerosmithDesc = "We begin our gallery of Top 20 American Bands in Boston, Mass., a key site in the Revolutionary War – and home to all-American bad boys Aerosmith. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry certainly had their '70s-era struggles, both personal and professional, but they simply refused to stay down. And, in this land of second chances, no one has played the role of bootstrap underdog better than Aerosmith as they ultimately scored one of rock history's most dramatic comebacks late in the next decade.";
const theBeachBoysDesc = "Brothers Carl, Dennis and Brian Wilson joined cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine to define the West Coast youth culture, as the Beach Boys combined gorgeous vocal harmonies with songs focusing on cars, girls and surfing. In some ways, they created the modern concept of California. Then, for a brief moment, they challenged the Beatles for wider pop-rock supremacy before Brian's creative fires began to flicker.";
const theDoorsDesc = "Forever associated with Los Angeles after forming there as film students at UCLA, the Doors originally hailed from places like Chicago and Florida. That led to a unique brand of Americanism that wasn't about flag-waving so much as upholding a rugged sense of individualism. Intent on bucking trends, as heard on the jazz-rock hit 'Light My Fire' and on protest songs like 'Five to One,' they emerged as musical revolutionaries";
const theEaglesDesc = "Initially featuring veteran performers from Poco, the Flying Burrito Brothers and Linda Ronstadt's band, the Eagles helped redirect rock back to its country roots – and then surprised everyone by mounting a series of unlikely late-period reunions with former members like Don Felder and then Bernie Leadon. They briefly called it quits upon co-founder Glenn Frey's too-early passing, before hitting the road again with Frey's son Deacon in his stead.";
const gunsNRosesDesc = "They too found success after traveling to California in search of fame and fortune. Both Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin originally called Indiana home, while Duff McKagan and Steven Adler came from Seattle and Cleveland, respectively. (Slash found his way to America from the U.K.) Together, they'd spark a late-'80s metal resurgence.";
const iggyPopDesc = "Like most revolutionaries, Iggy Pop and the Stooges were largely misunderstood in their own time. Founded in the psychedelic late '60s, these early punk-rock pioneers were met with derision and indifference during their early days. It was only much later that the Stooges' influence on rock was completely understood.";
const kissDesc = "Kiss is perhaps the most patriotic of any of the bands featured here. And not just because of tributes to their country like 'Rockin' In The U.S.A.' and 'All American Man,' among others. They've also shown a determination to take care of those who have served. In 2012, the group hired military man Paul Jordan onto their road crew, and in 2013 they donated a house to a wounded veteran. As big as their shows are, their hearts are that much bigger.";
const metallicaDesc ="Americans love a rags-to-riches story, and that pretty much sums it up for Metallica – a group of hard-driving legends who rose from the-then unknown thrash-metal underground to become new standard bearers for rock.";
const pearlJamDesc = "Since bursting onto the scene with 1991's Ten, Pearl Jam helped spearhead a change in the music industry. Over the years, they've consistently delivered passionate, powerful music that combines the riffs and musicianship of classic rock with the raw energy of punk";
const vanHalenDesc = "Few frontmen possess the bravado of vocalist David Lee Roth, a kind of modern-day Uncle Sam. There is simply no other culture in the world that could have nurtured a personality quite this out sized. Meanwhile, Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen has been the portrait of American ingenuity, helping to pioneer the finger-tap method of guitar-playing, a patented tuning system, and his own line of amplifiers and guitars.";
const zzTopDesc = "ZZ Top's no-frills guitars-bass-drums approach mirrors a straight-forward sense of pride in the forces that shaped them: Texas, and the blues. The '70s-era Worldwide Texas tour found ZZ Top performing on a stage shaped like their home state, which they tilted, so the crowd could see. ZZ Top also earned induction into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame for efforts in preserving blues music, one of America's great treasures.";
const slyAndTheFamilyStoneDesc = "With a groundbreaking lineup that brought male and female, and black and white, musicians together, Sly & the Family Stone presented a Utopian vision of America. It was also reflected in their songs, which blended rock, funk and pop in equal measures, with lyrics that could make you think about society while still making it possible to dance your ass off";
const theByrdsDesc = "Though their period of chart prominence in 1965-66 was far too brief, and the lineups around Roger McGuinn seemed to be continually shifting, the Byrds still emerged as one of the most revolutionary of rock bands. They forged a thrilling new melding of rock and folk, then stirring in raga and psychedelia, before leading a Paul Revere-esque charge forward as pioneers in the emerging country-rock scene";
