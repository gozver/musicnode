const desc01 = `Steinway's reputation and fame was gained from the advances they made in square piano building during the 19th Century and their designs and patents were used for decades. This piano is made in the Rococo Victorian Style with Cabriole legs. The case is made of stunning Brazilian Rosewood with a carved music rack and pedal lyre. Measures approximately 6'11" X 3'6". Refurbished and in very good condition.  A warm and rich sounding tone and a stunning eye catcher in any setting. Extremely heavy and requires specially equipped professional piano movers to transport safely.  Moving cost paid for by buyer.`;
